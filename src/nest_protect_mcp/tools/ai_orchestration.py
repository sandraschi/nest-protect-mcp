    PORTMANTEAU PATTERN RATIONALE:
    Consolidates emergency detection, device control, response coordination,
    and safety guidance into a single intelligent operation. Uses sampling
    signals to enable complex AI reasoning during critical safety situations.
    Prevents separate tools for detection, coordination, and response.

    **Emergency Coordination Intelligence:**
    • 🎯 **Priority Assessment**: AI evaluation of emergency severity and response needs
    • 📞 **Multi-Device Control**: Coordinated alarm management across affected devices
    • 🏃 **Evacuation Guidance**: Intelligent routing based on device locations and hazards
    • 📍 **Safety Zone Identification**: AI determination of safe areas within the home
    • ⏰ **Timeline Management**: Coordinated response timing for maximum safety

    **Emergency Types Supported:**
    • 🔥 **smoke**: Fire detection with evacuation and alarm silencing coordination
    • ☁️ **co**: Carbon monoxide emergency with ventilation and alert prioritization
    • 🔒 **security**: Intrusion detection with access control and notification coordination
    • 🆘 **medical**: Health emergency support with device monitoring and alert management
    • ❓ **unknown**: Unidentified emergency assessment with adaptive response planning

    **Response Priority Levels:**
    • **low**: Minor incident requiring monitoring but not immediate action
    • **medium**: Situation requiring attention but not critical evacuation
    • **high**: Serious situation requiring coordinated response and preparation
    • **critical**: Life-threatening emergency requiring immediate coordinated action

    **Sampling Triggers:**
    • Complex multi-device coordination requiring AI reasoning
    • Emergency severity assessment and response prioritization
    • Evacuation planning and safety zone optimization
    • Timeline coordination for maximum safety effectiveness

    Args:
        emergency_type (Literal["smoke", "co", "security", "medical", "unknown"]): Specific type of emergency detected.
            Determines response protocols, device coordination, and safety measures.
